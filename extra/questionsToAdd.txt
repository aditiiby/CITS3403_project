-Carbon is one of the most important elements to life on planet Earth. It forms more 
    compounds than any other element and forms the basis to all plant and animal life. 
    Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass and the second most 
    abundant element in the human body.
-Carbon is used in some way in most every industry in the world. It is used for fuel in the 
    form of coal, methane gas, and crude oil (which is used to make gasoline). It is used 
    to make all sorts of materials including plastics and alloys such as steel 
    (a combination of carbon and iron). It is even used to make black ink for printers and 
    painting. Graphite is often used in making batteries, brakes, and lubricants. It is 
    also used to make the writing (black) part of pencils. Diamonds are used to make fine 
    jewelry and are considered the most valuable of all the gemstones. Diamonds are also 
    used for their hardness in cutting tools and precision instruments.
- Carbon makes up about 18% of the human body. So if you weigh 100 pounds, your body contains
    around 18 pounds of carbon.


Nitrogen:
Almost 80% of our atmosphere 
Used to keep foods fresh(used in chip packets)
In its liquid form it is around minus 200 degrees Celsius, it is used in scientific facilities to store cells (sperm, egg)
Saturns moon titan has an atmosphere of 98% nitrogen it is the only moon in our solar system with a dense atmosphere

Iron:
FE
Most abundant of all metals
Necessary for life
	Exists in red blood cells (it is the reason they are red)
Earths inner and outer core are mostly comprised of iron
Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. (!!!can ask what compounds make steel)

Oxygen notes: 
Symbol: O 
Atomic Number: 8 
Atomic Weight: 15.999 
Classification: Gas and nonmetal 
Phase at Room Temperature: Gas 
Density: 1.429 g/L 
Melting Point: -218.79°C, -361.82°F 
Boiling Point: -182.95°C, -297.31°F 
Discovered by: Joseph Priestley in 1774 and C. W. Scheele independently in 1772

- Oxygen is an important element that is needed by most life forms on Earth to survive. 
- It is the third most abundant element in the universe and the most abundant element in 
the human body. 
- Oxygen has 8 electrons and 8 protons.
- It is located at the top of column 16 in the periodic table. 
- The oxygen cycle plays an important role in life on Earth. 


Characteristics and Properties:
- Under standard conditions oxygen forms a gas that is composed of molecules consisting of
 two oxygen atoms (O2). 
- This is called a diatomic gas. In this form oxygen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless
 gas. 

Where is oxygen found on Earth? 
- Oxygen is found all around us. It is one of the most important elements on planet Earth. 
- Oxygen makes up around 21% of the Earth's atmosphere and 50% of the mass of the Earth's crust. 
- Oxygen is one of the atoms that makes up water (H2O). Oxygen is an important element to life on Earth. 
- It is the most abundant element in the human body making up around 65% of the body's mass. 

How is oxygen used today? 
- Oxygen is used by animals and plants in the respiration (breathing) process. 
- Tanks of oxygen are used in medicine to treat people with breathing problems. 
- They are also used as life support for astronauts and scuba divers. 
- The majority of the oxygen used in industry is used in the manufacturing of steel. 
- Other applications include making new compounds such as plastics 
and creating a very hot flame for welding. 
- Liquid oxygen is combined with liquid hydrogen to make rocket fuel. 

Interesting Facts about Oxygen 
- Oxygen dissolves in cool water easier than in warm water. 
- Water can be converted into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. 
- The oxygen that is found in the air is produced by photosynthesis. 
- Without plants, there would be very little oxygen in the air. 
- In the solar system, only the Earth has a high percentage of oxygen. 
- Oxygen atoms make up an essential part of proteins and DNA in our bodies. 
- The process of oxygen combining with other atoms to make compounds is called oxidation.

Helium notes: 

- Helium is the second lightest and second most common element in the universe.
- It is at the top of the noble gas group in the periodic table. It has 2 electrons and 2 protons.
- It is located at the top of column 18 in the periodic table.

Characteristics and Properties 
- At room temperature helium is an odorless, tasteless, colorless gas. 
- It has very low boiling and melting points, meaning that it is generally found in the gas phase except under the most extreme of conditions. 
- Helium is the only element that does not solidify under ordinary pressures and remains a liquid even at absolute zero. 
- Helium is one of the inert or noble gases.
- This means that its outside electron shell is filled with electrons. 
- This makes it very unreactive and non-flammable. 

Where is helium found on Earth?
- Helium is fairly rare on Earth. 
- There is very little in the Earth's atmosphere because it is so light that it eventually escapes into outer space. 
- Scientists believe that most of the helium in the universe was created at the formation of the universe. 
- However, new helium is created in the center of stars and also as part of radioactive decay on Earth. 
- Helium from radioactive decay can be found trapped underground in natural gas reservoirs. 

Stars 
- Helium is constantly being produced at the internal cores of stars. 
- Deep inside a star, intense pressures cause hydrogen atoms to convert into helium atoms. 
- This creates the energy, heat, and light that powers the stars and the sun. 
- This conversion is called nuclear fusion. 

How is helium used today?
- Helium is used in balloons and airships to make them float. 
- It is not as light at hydrogen, but is a much safer gas as hydrogen is very flammable. 
- The largest industrial user of helium gas is MRI scanners which use the gas to keep the superconducting magnets cool. 
- Other applications include silicon wafers for electronics and as a protective gas for arc welding. 

Interesting Facts about Helium 
- The speed of sound in helium is around three times the speed of sound in the air. 
- This causes people's voices to get high pitched and squeaky when they breathe helium (note: never breathe helium as you can suffocate if you breathe too much). 
- Helium has never been observed by scientists to bond with another element to form a compound. 
- It is often mixed with oxygen in scuba air tanks to dilute the oxygen.
- It is used instead of nitrogen because it will not dissolve in the blood and will leave the human body quicker. 
- In general, helium will not combine with itself to create molecules, but is found as a single atom
