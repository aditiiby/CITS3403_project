Lessons 

1. hydren 
2. Oxygen
3. Helium 
4. carbon 
5. Nitrogen 
6. Ion

Hydron notes:
- Lightest element on earth 
- consists of one protien and one eletron 
- when hydren and oxygen come together they crearte water.
- it makes up more than 90 % of the of all atoms in the universe 
- Hydrogen gas is what makes up the stars, including our sun 
- Symbol: H Atomic Number: 1 
- Atomic Weight: 1.00794 
- Classification: Nonmetal 
- Phase at Room Temperature: 
- Gas Density: 0.08988 g/L @ 0°C 
- Melting Point: -259.14°C, -434.45°F 
- Boiling Point: -252.87°C, -423.17°F 
- Discovered by: Henry Cavendish in 1766
- At standard temperature and pressure hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas.
- Hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel where liquid hydrogen is combined with liquid oxygen
    to produce a powerful explosion. Scientists hope that someday hydrogen can be used as a 
    clean fuel alternative to gasoline.


Carbon notes :
- Symbol: C Atomic Number: 6 
- Atomic Weight: 12.011 
- Classification: Nonmetal 
- Phase at Room Temperature: Solid 
- Density: amorphous: 1.8 to 2.1, diamond: 3.515, graphite: 2.267 grams per cm cubed
- Melting Point (diamond): 3550°C, 6442°F 
- Boiling Point (diamond): 4200°C, 7600°F 
- Sublimation Point (graphite): 3642°C, 6588°F 
- Discovered by: Carbon has been known about since ancient times
-Carbon is one of the most important elements to life on planet Earth. It forms more 
    compounds than any other element and forms the basis to all plant and animal life. 
    Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass and the second most 
    abundant element in the human body.
-Carbon is used in some way in most every industry in the world. It is used for fuel in the 
    form of coal, methane gas, and crude oil (which is used to make gasoline). It is used 
    to make all sorts of materials including plastics and alloys such as steel 
    (a combination of carbon and iron). It is even used to make black ink for printers and 
    painting. Graphite is often used in making batteries, brakes, and lubricants. It is 
    also used to make the writing (black) part of pencils. Diamonds are used to make fine 
    jewelry and are considered the most valuable of all the gemstones. Diamonds are also 
    used for their hardness in cutting tools and precision instruments.
- Carbon makes up about 18% of the human body. So if you weigh 100 pounds, your body contains
    around 18 pounds of carbon.
